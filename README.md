# First-Game-cpp
My first game in C++. It was written 4 years ago. You can play alone or with a friend. 

## Rules
The rules are simple: the thief (T) must rob the bank ($$) and head to the airport (AI), while the police (P) must stop the thief. 

## Controls
- [w/a/s/d] - second player
- [↑/←/↓/→] - move in menu and first player
- [space/enter] - select

## Notice 
In single-player, the police bot hasn't been added yet.

The game is not optimized (at that time, I was just starting to program). 

Enjoy and have fun!
