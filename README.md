# First-Game-cpp
My first game in C++. It was written 4 years ago. You can play alone or with a friend. The rules are simple: the thief (T) must rob the bank ($$) and head to the airport (AI), while the police (P) must stop the thief. In the single-player game, the police bot has not been implemented yet. The game is not optimized (at that time, I was just starting to program).
